Rough TODO
~~~~~~~~~~

major features:
    * action item watcher (integrate w/ IDEA alert mechanism on AI state 
        change, akin to current standalone tray program?)
    * adding support for hg and p4 (the other two SCMs intellij supports OOTB)
    * full review interface akin to eclipse plugin (this would be a much larger
        undertaking than what presently exists, but is theoretically possible)
    
minor features:
    * allow commit selection from SCM log, not just via file context menu
    * script build so that it doesn't require manually doing so in IDEA?
        (gradle?)

known bugs:
    * selection of multiple commits does not seem to work presently (0.7 beta)
        (it makes multiple reviews and does not upload the commits to them)

Some changes while playing with github integration
